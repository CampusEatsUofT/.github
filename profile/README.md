Currently, it has come to our attention that there are a variety of food service options on our campus, including the residence cafeteria, food trucks, and nearby restaurants. However, the vast majority of these establishments solely offer in-person ordering, leading to inconveniently lengthy wait times during peak times (e.g. UofT times).

In addition, we understand the challenges posed by high delivery and platform fees on the current online ordering platforms. These fees can limit students‚Äô access to nearby restaurant options while on campus. We aim to mitigate this issue and provide a more affordable solution.

Consequently, we would like to develop a mobile app named CampusEats, allowing users to place orders online with ease, browse food menus, provide diverse meal options/plans, and unlock exclusive discounts tailored to students. Our mission is to provide a better dining solution for all campus members.
